Begin Ramble:

So I'm part of a coworking community in Manhattan called New Work City (http://nwcny.com) We have the Wifidog (http://wifidog.org) hotspot software running on a coworking space in New York City. It's great software and provides a lot, including a customizable portal page for each hotspot.  I found the most important piece of information on that page was the list of who was online at the hotspot right now.  

The problem: the portal page is kind of hidden unless you're actually at the hotspot.  It's public, but the URL is a long string that includes the hotspot's node id:
https://auth.nycwireless.net/portal/?node_id=c86b27e6bf325a8d2054d15234136fea

Ugh.  I didn't want to see the whole page, just the user list.   So first I created a shortlink to the portal page (http://bit.ly/inthehouse).   Then I put a couple requests on the wifidog mailing list about how to pull just this info.  They're talking about doing an API, but it didn't sound like it'd happen immediately.  

So I did some research and realized you can use Javascript JQuery to parse the page.  You just need something to load it for the Javascript.  So there are really just two files: a PHP file (curl.php) that loads the page and an HTML file (inndex.html) with the javascript to just pull out the members module. 

You'll need to modify curl.php to have your node's portal page url from your wifidog auth server. Right now it's set to New Work City to show how it works:

https://auth.nycwireless.net/portal/?node_id=c86b27e6bf325a8d2054d15234136fea 

This could be better.  It could be a real RSS feed, for one. It could also do away with the PHP and do it some way that's programming-language-agnostic.  If not it could have simple versions of different coders' server side language of choice (ASP, Ruby on Rails, Python, etc.)
 
Open to hacking.
